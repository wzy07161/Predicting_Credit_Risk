# Credit Risk Prediction Dashboard

This project presents a machine learning solution for predicting credit risk, developed as part of CPSC 330 coursework. The accompanying HTML report (`Analysis.ipynb`) summarizes the modeling pipeline, evaluation metrics, and key insights derived from the data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a predictive model to assess credit risk based on a labeled dataset. The process involved:

- **Data preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numeric features
- **Model selection:** Comparing multiple supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Evaluation:** Using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to assess performance
- **Interpretation:** Analyzing feature importance and model behavior to understand risk drivers

## Key Features

- Clean, interactive HTML report generated via Jupyter Notebook
- Visualizations for data distribution, feature importance, and model performance
- Demonstration of end-to-end ML pipeline using `scikit-learn` and `xgboost`

## Requirements

To run the notebook and reproduce results, you will need:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
